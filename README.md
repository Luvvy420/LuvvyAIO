# LuvvyAIO

# luvvyaio  
my attempt to learn C++ ~ built with love, caffeine, and way too much testing!

---

## What is luvvyaio  
luvvyaio is my personal plugin bundle

---

## Why I built it  
this whole project feels reminds me of my diablo 2 open battle.net days! except now the “hero editor” is my compiler, and the battlefield is no longer the blood moor. I love testing, experimenting, and finding creative solutions. I live for that “omgg it’s working!!” moment.

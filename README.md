# luvvyaio  
built with love, caffeine, and way too much testing.

## What is luvvyaio  
luvvyaio is my personal plugin bundle

---

## Why I built it  
This whole project feels like my personal Diablo 2 Open Battle.net 2.0! except now the “hero editor” is my compiler, and the battlefield is no longer the blood moor. The thrill of trying new creative ideas or solutions to tasks i couldn't figure out at first, seeing them compile without errors (sometimes), and testing them in game is addictive. I live for that “OMG!! IT WORKS!” moment!
